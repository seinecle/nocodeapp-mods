## A note on Umigon: best of its class 
[A comparative study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01818) has found that out of 24 solutions, Umigon is the best performer üèÅ for sentiment analysis on social media text in English. See the table below and check [the paper behind Umigon](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S13-2068.pdf):

Note: "3-Classes" at the top of the left column means that the 24 solutions are judged on their performance on analyzing sentiments in three categories: positive, neutral and negative. "2-Classes" means that the solutions are tested on texts which are only positive or negative in sentiment. Umigon was released in 2012 and has been continuously updated and improved since.

When installing the app on Windows, you will get a warning sign as Windows is really annoying with certificates. These are the screenshots you will encounter, and where you should click:
