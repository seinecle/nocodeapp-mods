# Downloads
See below in the "Assets" sub-menu to download the app for windows and linux

# What is the app about
"no code app" (provisional title) is a free desktop app to run popular data science jobs. No registration required. 2 functions at the moment:

- Umigon: sentiment analysis on French and English texts.
- Cowo: better word clouds.

The app is currently in alpha, meaning that it is not a good first version: ugly and almost no documentation. But it already works and you can test it.

# Limitations
- Mac: still impossible to install it because of certification issues.
- Linux and Windows: should work out of the box

# Changes of the latest release
- removed a conflicting library.

# Next steps
This app checks for updates when it launches. New updates include bug fixes, new functions and any improvement that a user can suggest. Post your suggestions on Github (here: https://github.com/seinecle/nocodeapp/issues) or ping Cl√©ment Levallois on Twitter (username: @seinecle)
