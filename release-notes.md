# Downloads
See below in the "Assets" sub-menu to download the app for mac, windows and linux

# What is the app about
"no code app" (provisional title) is a free desktop app to run popular data science jobs, such a sentiment analysis on texts. The app is currently in alpha, meaning that it is not a good first version: ugly and almost no documentation. But it already works and you can test it.

# Limitations
- Mac: still impossible to install it because of certification issues.
- Linux and Windows: should work out of the box

# changes
- bug fix: the directory for app files was missing (thx to https://twitter.com/nrv75 for this).
