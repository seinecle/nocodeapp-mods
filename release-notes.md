# changes

## in-app user experience
- created a logger that gives the user real time feedback on the operations being performed.

## installation / os
- changed the location of the config file to user.home, which should cause less trouble in terms of admin rights needed to create the folder and file at this location

## build / infrastructure
- added metadata to the release instructions for mac, win and linux
