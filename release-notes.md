# What is the app about
"no code app" (provisional title) is a free desktop app to run popular data science jobs, such a sentiment analysis on texts. The app is currently in alpha, meaning that it is not a good first version: ugly and almost no documentation. But it already works and you can test it.

# Limitations
- Mac: still not sure it works before of certification issues. Try it and report at clementlevallois@protonmail.com
- Linux and Windows: should work out of the box

# changes

## installation / os
- macOS: the app is certified and notarized. Mac users to install the app (before this, Mac blocked the install because the app was not signed)
- all os: the config and plugin folders are now created in the user.home directory, which should remove the need to have admin rights to run the app.
